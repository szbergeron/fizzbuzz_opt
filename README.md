This is an experiment to see just how fast fizzbuzz can be made

Currently the fastest algorithm tested is represented by fopt1,
which avoids using modulo or inverse multiply and instead uses a purely arithmetical
approach. A test of reduced branching was introduced with fopt3, but this turned out
to not optimize as well.
